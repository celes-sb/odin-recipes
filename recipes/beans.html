      <h1>Butter beans with a spicy zing</h1>
      <p>
        “I was told that chillies are medicine, that they can assist in bringing
        passion and awaken the inner creative fire inside. Although, let’s
        remember that no two chillies are the same. Some have a larger punch
        than others. This dish is fire and spicy, with lots of herbs and a zesty
        vibe from the lemon. Perfect for dunking into or to complement a salad.

            <li>1½ tablespoons za’atar</li>
            <li>150g/5½oz/1¼ cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>
              a handful of flat leaf parsley leaves, chopped, plus extra to
              serve
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add
              the chilli and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the
              butter beans, za’atar and tomatoes. Season with a large pinch of
              salt and pepper and stir.
            </li>
            <li>
              To make the filling, divide the soaked cashews in half and place
              one half in the blender with the peanut butter, vanilla extract,
              agave and water and blend until smooth. If the filling is too
              thick and isn’t coming together, add an extra tablespoon of water
              at a time. Add the melted coconut oil and blend until well
              combined. Transfer the mixture to a jar or bowl and set aside
              while you make the chocolate filling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the parsley leaves, lemon juice and lemon zest. Stir for 10
              minutes until the tomatoes are softened but still with a bit of
              bite.
            </li>
            <li>
              Season with a little more black pepper, then serve sprinkled with
              fresh parsley.
            </li>
