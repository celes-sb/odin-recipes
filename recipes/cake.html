      “This is a dessert that I created on a retreat, where the sea and its
      dancing waves inspired the cake’s swirls. Sweet but salty, with a vanilla
      and peanut taste. My grandma tells me often that when fear captures me or
      I feel overwhelmed, to sit with water, to get inspired by it. She tells me
      that water can be strong and delicate at the same time; it moves around
      obstacles gently, it doesn’t fear where it’s going, it doesn’t get caught
      up in the future, it just adapts to what is in its way. Water reminds me
      to flow in life, and when I’m in flow mode, I create. ”

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>160g/5¾oz/1 cup whole almonds</li>
      <li>
        160g/5¾oz/¾ cup pitted dates (I use deglet noor, as they are cheaper
        than medjool dates)
      </li>
      <li>a pinch of salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon coconut oil, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><p>For the filling</p></li>
      <li>250g/9oz/1¾ cups cashews, soaked for 4–6 hours, then drained</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><p>White Part</p></li>
      <li>125g/4½oz/½ cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 drops of pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons agave syrup</li>
      <li>250ml/9fl oz/1 cup water</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons coconut oil, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Dark Part</p></li>
      <li>a large pinch of salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons agave syrup</li>
      <li>250ml/9fl oz/1 cup water</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons cacao powder</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons coconut oil, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the base, pulse the almonds and dates in a food processor until
        broken down, then add the salt and melted coconut oil and blend for a
        few minutes until well combined and the mixture is starting to stick
        together. Spoon the mixture into a 23cm/9in loose-bottomed cake pan and
        press down firmly to cover the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the filling, divide the soaked cashews in half and place one
        half in the blender with the peanut butter, vanilla extract, agave and
        water and blend until smooth. If the filling is too thick and isn’t
        coming together, add an extra tablespoon of water at a time. Add the
        melted coconut oil and blend until well combined. Transfer the mixture
        to a jar or bowl and set aside while you make the chocolate filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the other half of the soaked cashews in the food processor with
        the salt, agave, water and cacao powder until smooth. If the filling is
        too thick and isn’t coming together, add an extra tablespoon of water at
        a time. Add the melted coconut oil and blend until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour some of the chocolate filling into the tart pan to create a circle,
        then pour some of the peanut filling on top, and repeat until both are
        used up. Use a chopstick to create swirls in the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the freezer for 3 hours or in the refrigerator overnight to
        set. If frozen it needs to thaw at room temperature before cutting and
        serving.
