      “When I first started eating more plants many moons ago, vegan food was
      pretty bland and pretty basic. I remember going for dinner and eating a
      roasted cauliflower and thinking WTF is this. It was so dry, with no
      sauce, expensive and it didn’t fill me up. It did however get me thinking
      about how I can make it better and as healthy and delicious as possible.
      That’s the thing about not liking something, or there being a lack of
      options: it can be an invitation to get in the kitchen and make it better.
      This is how new creations are born. This roasted cauliflower is smothered
      with a tart chimichurri sauce, loaded with sweet tomatoes, and sprinkled
      with spicy, crunchy pepitas. It’s all about the layers! Serve with
      plantain (see page 156 of Plant Feasts), Cumin and Garlic Potatoes (see
      page 146), Quinoa, Tomato and Avocado Salad (see page 95), and Spicy Mango
      and Palm Heart Salad (see page 98) for an epic feast. ”

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 large cauliflower (or 2 small), cut lengthways into 2cm/¾in slices
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
      <li>
        a handful of Sweet and Super-Spicy Coconut Pepitas (see page 173 of
        Plant Feasts), to serve
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>For the chimichurri</p>
      <li>15g/½oz/½ cup mint leaves</li>
      <li>40g/1½oz/1 cup flat leaf parsley leaves</li>
      <li>40g/1½oz/1 cup coriander/cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>3 jalapeños, deseeded</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, peeled</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried chilli/hot pepper flakes</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>a large pinch of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>For the Pico de Gallo</p>
      <li>
        5 large tomatoes (I use Roma, approx. 450g/1lb), deseeded and finely
        chopped
      </li>
      <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>a handful of coriander/cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</li>
      <li>
        Arrange the cauliflower slices on a baking sheet, coat with the olive
        oil and add the cumin and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in the
        oven for 40 minutes, turning halfway through. The cauliflower should be
        slightly golden and softened but with a slight bite.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the chimichurri, blend all the ingredients in a food processor,
        adding olive oil bit by bit, until you get a chunky sauce. Transfer to a
        bowl or airtight container. Any that you don’t use can be kept for up to
        a week in the refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the pico de gallo, gently mix the tomatoes and red onion, then
        mix in the coriander, lemon juice and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, first lay the cauliflower down, smother with the
        chimichurri, then load the pico de gallo on top. Sprinkle with pepitas
        and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
